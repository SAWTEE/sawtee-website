Title: Initiating Dialogue on Post-Disaster Reconstruction (Edited volume)
Provider-Name: South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE)<LF>
Abstract: Conventional wisdom among policymakers and the public is that a "Big One" is always waiting to occur in Nepal as the country straddles the Himalayan fault lines. However, when the 2015-Gorkha Earthquake actually occurred, everyone appeared to be caught by surprise. Later, reconstruction activities made it evident that even "Nepalâ€™s" preparedness and planning to withstand the aftermath of such disasters and their impacts were woefully inadequate. Considering Nepals vulnerability to multiple types of hazards, it is necessary to review the policies and efforts towards 'building back better' so that the country can spring back from such calamities with less pain. This book is a collection of essays by economists, planners and practitioners of disaster management, urban planning, migration, conflict management and gender relations. It is their attempt to highlight the efforts that worked and those that did not during the post disaster phases of rescue, relief and reconstruction.

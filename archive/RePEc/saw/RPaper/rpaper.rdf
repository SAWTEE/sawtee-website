Title: Nepal-India Treaty of Trade: Avenues for amendments<CR>
Abstract: Although Nepal gains duty-free access in India for almost all of its products, some provisions of the bilateral trade treaty constrain Nepalâ€™s exports to India. Furthermore, some of the reciprocal provisions of the treaty do not pay heed to the huge asymmetry in the size of the economies and their levels of development. This paper suggests amendments that could mitigate the main deficiencies in the current version of the treaty, as well as implementation and miscellaneous issues that need to be addressed to make bilateral trade more mutually beneficial.<CR>

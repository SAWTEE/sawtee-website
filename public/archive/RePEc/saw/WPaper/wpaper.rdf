Title: Green Growth and Trade in Environmental Goods and Services : A South Asian Perspective<LF></LF>
Abstract:  Our investigation into the state of Green Growth in South Asia through a rigorous analysis of carbon dioxide emission, energy supply, energy consumption, power generation, and carbon intensity of growth does not find any evidence that South Asia is making the switch to an environmental friendly growth. The unsustainable modes of production and consumption still fuel the growth in South Asia and carbon emissions are perpetually rising. This environmentally hazardous growth model could be transmuted, inter alia, through extensive trade in Environmental Goods and Services (EGS). By mitigating environmental pollution, enhancing energy efficiency, augmenting the use of renewable energy, and promoting environmental industries and creating green jobs, substantial trade of EGS can reduce environmental degradation as well as promote growth. Thus,
the paper complements the preceding analysis on the state of Green Growth by an in-depth analysis of this potential enabler of green growth, with a strong focus on South Asia. Our assessment suggests that trade in Environmental Goods is not at a level to promote the transition to a green economy in South Asia. Although the trade of Environmental Goods exhibits an increasing trend, it is almost exclusively the result of rising imports. Furthermore, assessment of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) suggests a poor state of environmental industries in South Asia, except for India. Moreover, significant barriers to trade of EGS exist indicating that the current level of EGS trade is nowhere near the potential. Against this backdrop of carbon-heavy growth and largely untapped potential in the trade of Environmental Goods and Services, the
paper argues for a comprehensive WTO Agreement on Environmental Goods, one that also simplifies the trade of Environmental Services, and pays special attention to the needs of Member States well below the environmental technology frontier, like the ones in South Asia.<LF></LF>

Title: From Tatopani to Rasuwa : An analysis of Nepal-China trade after the earthquake<LF></LF>
Abstract: This paper analyses changes in Nepal's trade with China in the wake of the 2015 earthquake, which was followed by a blockade of the Nepal-India border. Using monthly trade data to obtain trade flows over subperiods of less than a year, it first shows how the blockade compounded the earthquake's blow to trade. It, then, dissects Nepal-China trade performance and patterns at the product level, customs point/route level and product-customs point/route level. With Tatopani-Zhangmu, the main commercial trading point on the Nepal-China border, shut after the earthquake and Rasuwagadhi-Kerung, a recently opened trading point with a barely motorable road, unable to fully absorb the diverted trade traffic, portions of Nepal’s overland imports from China were forced to take a costly detour via sea. The share of overland imports from China fell from 24 per cent before the earthquake to 12 per cent two years after the quake. There was a general shift towards using both sea and air routes rather than just a single route for imports. The time cost imposed by the enforced sea detour for imports is equivalent to a tariff of 18 per cent to 62 per cent. The share of overland exports to China fell from 69 per cent to 43 per cent. While changes in routes were stark for imports, they were modest for exports that initially used Tatopani. The limited route changes for exports occurred overwhelmingly towards the air route rather than the sea route. The relative importanceof exports to China via air has increased, but total exports to China, as of the end of Fiscal Year 2016/17, were yet to be restored to pre-earthquake levels. The paper discusses likely issues in the future of NepalChina trade through the lens of transport and transit, including the emergence of the Rasuwagadhi-Kerung option. As a landlocked country, Nepal’s strategy should be to diversify trade and transit routes, exploring all options. The temptation to make a cost-benefit analysis comparing trade costs along different routes, without factoring in the value of transit needs, must be avoided.<LF>

Title: Mechanization in Nepalese agriculture : Potential knowledge gaps and significance<LF>
Abstract:  The essay evidences that while the dominant narrative on mechanization is essentially about large farms, capital intensive equipment and canal irrigation system, a less-highlighted, "heterodox" strand in scholarship provides evidence that there are major differences in the way countries like India and Bangladesh have progressed in mechanization. Although there are overlaps in the two strategies, the paper argues that recognizing the differences has scholarship and policy significance for Nepal and for the rest of the region if an effective mechanization strategy is to be devised. The paper observes that
    if India's mechanization is largely explained by the dominant approach, made feasible by its fiscal, institutional and industrial capacity, Bangladesh's mechanization is based on small, inexpensive and multipurpose equipment. Indeed, Bangladesh achieving significant mechanization despite sustained land fragmentation has especial salience for Nepal.  In Nepal, like Bangladesh, smallholders form the bulk of farmer households while fragmentation is on the rise. Moreover, rapid emigration to foreign lands for work has created labour shortages on the farm while, owing to the agriculture sector stagnation and remittance-driven credibly rising consumption capabilities, imports of agricultural goods are soaring. Credible policy support in mechanization is identified as having contributed to Bangladesh`s success.
    While much of the agriculture mechanization scholarship on Nepal finds that mechanization is low and confined to specific geography such as the Tarai plains, the paper contends, drawing out of some estimation efforts from a less-discussed strand of the literature, that the prevailing narrative may be simplistic, if not erroneous. The argument is that the analytical frame used in much of the existing scholarship is narrow as it does not consider small equipment largely because of ideological and
    political reasons; indeed, much of the existing knowledge is based on the dominant paradigm. The essay contendsthat, inter alia, this potentially preventsformation of a credible picture which can then be exercised in devising policy interventions for increasing mechanization; considered a potent tool to shore up stagnant agricultural productivity. Upon broadening the analytical frame, i.e., inclusion of small equipment, there is suggestive evidence (quantitative estimates in, for instance, some case- studies) to indicate that rural mechanization, driven by inexpensive small equipment, may well be occurring in Nepal; including in the hills and mountains, areas considered poorly mechanized in the existing literature. Interestingly, much of even the dominant paradigm literature does make some passing references to small equipment-drive mechanization and that this has resulted in efficient agronomic practices in certain pockets. The article contends that to devise a suitable mechanization strategy, there is need for more research on this dimension of farm mechanization, beginning with acredible analysis of rural capital goods that does not equate mechanization with the use of large
    equipment.<LF></LF>

Title: Industrialization, input duties and revenue concerns in Nepal<LF>
Abstract: This paper seeks to contribute to the discourse on industrialization in Nepal. It shows that it would be premature to write off manufacturing-powered industrialization. It emphasizes that the debate over whether protecting domestic industry from import competition as part of an industrialization strategy works or not is far from settled. It discusses Nepal's muddled input-tariff policy for exports, and examines whether there are valid revenue loss concerns behind the anti-export bias of the tariff policy. While existing research on Nepal suggests revenue loss is not significant if tariff elimination is targeted at inputs used by a few key export products, the paper suggests further extensions and lines of inquiry, taking into account alternative scenarios. Finally, it highlights some questions, trade-offs and issues in tariff setting for the Government of Nepal to ponder.<LF></LF>

Title: Nepal's elusive quest for export success meets LDC graduation<LF></LF>
Abstract: Nepal is hurtling towards graduation from the least developed country (LDC) category with a low per capita income and meagre exports. This paper analyses the implications of graduation for Nepal's exports, and suggests measures that Nepal government should take to mitigate the adverse effects. It argues that export success has eluded Nepal despite trade preferences, and graduation could make it even more elusive. The fact that the prospect of tapping the country's export potential is partly predicated on preferential tariffs implies much higher export losses than projected by standard modelling exercises. Not factoring in changes in rules of origin in preference-granting countries adds to the downward bias of existing estimates. All this underlines the urgency of building productive capacity, alleviating supply-side constraints, and strengthening factors of non-price competitiveness.

Title: The 66/77 products inside out: The long and short of the United States’ Nepal Trade Preference Programme<LF></LF>
Abstract: This paper contributes to the limited literature on the effects of unilateral trade preferences on exports by assessing the effect of a unilateral duty-free market access scheme offered by the United States to Nepal, a landlocked least developed country, for a 10-year period. Launched in 2016 to support Nepal in the wake of the devastating earthquake of the previous year and having obtained a waiver from a non-discrimination requirement at the World Trade Organization, the Nepal Trade Preference Programme(NTPP) provides duty-free access on 66 products (later converted into 77 products after a change in the tariff classification system) from Nepal. We find that there are overlaps in the product coverage of the NTPP and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the latter applicable to a broader group of developing countries. In 2021, some 21 percent of Nepal’s exports to the US (in value terms) were potentially eligible for GSP only, 5 percent for NTPP only and 3 percent for both. Preference utilization was lower among NTPP products than GSP products. Employing difference-in-differences and triple-difference estimations on detailed product-level data, we do not find conclusive evidence that the introduction of the NTPP led to an increase in Nepal’s exports of the products the scheme granted duty-free market access to.

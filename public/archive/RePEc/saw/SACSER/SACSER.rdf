Title:  Nuances in agriculture mechanization
Book-Title: South Asian cooperation: Issues old and new (Edited volume)
Abstract:  While the share of agriculture in national output is declining, the sector remains the largest employer across the region. South Asian countries differ in their experiences with mechanization, progress in which is a potent tool to shore up agricultural productivity. In Chapter 8, Avinash Gupta explores the nuances of agriculture mechanization, comparing Nepal's experiences with those of other countries, particularly Bangladesh and India. Gupta argues that while the dominant narrative on mechanization is essentially about large farms, capital-intensive equipment and canal irrigation system, a less-highlighted, heterodox narrative provides evidence that there are major differences in the way countries like India and Bangladesh have progressed in mechanization. Although there are overlaps between the two strategies, recognizing the differences is crucial for Nepal and for the rest of the region to devise an eff ective mechanization strategy. The author observes that if India's mechanization is largely explained by the dominant approach, made feasible by its fiscal, institutional and industrial capacity, Bangladesh's mechanization is based on small, inexpensive and multipurpose equipment, focusing on smallholder farmers. Bangladesh achieving significant mechanization with the heterodox approach despite sustained land fragmentation has especial salience for Nepal, where smallholders form the bulk of farmers, fragmentation is on the rise, rapid emigration to foreign lands for work has created labour shortages on the farm, and imports of agricultural goods are soaring. Credible policy support is identified as having contributed to Bangladesh's success.

      'SAWTEE continues to build the capacity of concerned stakeholders so as to better equip them with information and advocacy tools. One of SAWTEE’s capacity-building programmes, “Media Fellowship for Economic Journalists,” offers fellowships to Nepali journalists covering trade and economic matters. The main objective of the fellowship is to present a unique opportunity for economic journalists to deepen their knowledge, expand their network, and contribute to the public’s understanding of critical economic and trade issues. In 2023, five media professionals were chosen to delve into topics including Nepal’s international trade issues, balance of payments, Nepal’s graduation from the least developed country (LDC) category, and trade through a gender lens. The selection process was based on the quality of their proposals and their prior experience. The recipients of the 2023 media fellowship programme are as follows:',

          'Before being awarded this fellowship, my reporting on international trade was limited to basic issues. Although I was aware of Nepal graduating from the least developed country (LDC) category to a developing country, I had limited idea about its implications for Nepal’s trade, especially with regard to exports to the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK). This fellowship provided me with an opportunity to understand various aspects of Nepal’s LDC graduation. I believe that this experience will help me in enhancing my understanding of similar trade-related issues in the future. This experience also allowed me to understand and analyze different technical aspects of the effects of Nepal’s graduation from LDC status. It has not only changed my perspective on the subject matter but I have gained insights into the ways to examine this issue.',
          'Consultations with Dr. Paras Kharel, Executive Director, SAWTEE, helped me understand the technical and practical aspects of LDC graduation and its implications. Our interactions have made me realize that there is ample room for me to nurture my interest in, and improve my understanding of, this topic. I had an opportunity to learn about “rules of origin” which will have a long-term impact on the export sector of Nepal after it graduates from the LDC category but is missing in the discourse in the media. Finally, I would like to thank SAWTEE for granting me this fellowship and providing me with the opportunity to learn. May we continue to cooperate in the future as well. ',

For the first time in my two-decade journey in journalism, through this fellowship, I got an opportunity to learn from experts outside the media circle. Understanding the issues of international trade and economics through this association with South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) has been a positively unique experience. ',
          'Considering the deteriorated balance of payments situation in 2021, the Nepal government imposed a ban on imports of certain items for about six months beginning in April 2022 and Nepal’s central bank introduced a 50-100 percent cash margin requirement on imports of certain items beginning in December 2021 that lasted a year. This fellowship provided me with an opportunity to delve deeper into the implications of the import ban on Nepal’s economy while writing an article in Capital Business magazine.',
          'Despite the limited time, the collaboration with SAWTEE helped me understand how to approach a new subject matter and undertake an in-depth analysis of it. It also gave me insights into how decisions such as the ban and other financial tools used by the government and the central bank impact the economy and common people and what is the role of the authorities in addressing the adverse impact. SAWTEE’s mentors also helped me in various aspects of the content and even language-related accuracy during the reporting. This reporting opportunity has provided me with new perspectives on the issues and opened up ways to examine international trade-related issues that have been ignored.',

          'It was a unique experience to be part of the SAWTEE Media Fellowship on the Nexus of Trade and Climate Change. My stories focused on two key themes: first, how climate change could jeopardize Nepal’s energy trade prospects, and second, the deteriorating conditions of roads connecting Kathmandu Valley—Nepal’s major economic hub—and how this impacts the cost of trade logistics, particularly in the supply of raw materials and essential goods.',
          ' In the second story, I examined how erratic rainfall in September 2024 led to a spike in commodity prices, making common people bear the brunt of climate-induced disruptions. The early rains before the formal onset of the monsoon served as a stark reminder of how challenging the rainy season could be for Kathmandu Valley residents. Exploring the intersection of trade and climate change was an intellectually rewarding journey. It involved engagement with authorities and stakeholders to gather data and information. My fellowship stories were published in late December 2024 and January 2025.',
          'This experience has further motivated me to explore policy impacts, necessary interventions, and the externalities tied to climate resilience and trade. I extend my heartfelt thanks to SAWTEE for this invaluable opportunity—especially to Vice Chairperson Ravi Shanker Sainju, Executive Director Dr. Paras Kharel, and Programme Coordinator Dikshya Singh, with whom I closely worked and interacted during the fellowship. I sincerely hope SAWTEE continues to offer such platforms to many more media fellows in the future.  Thank you! ',
